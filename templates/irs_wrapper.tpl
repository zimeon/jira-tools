\section*{{RepoExec IR Subgroup Report - DRAFT {date}}}

Summary report of features and policies needed to support the institutional
repository user stories identified by the 
\href{{https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/MzF0Ew}}{{IR User Stories Working Group}}.
Prepared by the 
\href{{https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/pwxSDg}}{{RepoExec}} IR Subgroup.
This report is intended as a resource to help guide the continuing 
development of a Sufia-Hydra based IR solution for Cornell University.

\section{{Methodology}}

Each user story from the the IR User Stories Working Group report was 
interrogated to determine which features and policies would be necessary 
to support that user story. This method resulted in a list of features 
and policies, which were then prioritized as \textbf{{Critical}}, 
\textbf{{Major}}, or \textbf{{Low}}, using the following criteria:

\begin{{itemize}} 
\item \textbf{{Critical}} - This feature is a core function of the repository,
absolutely necessary for its operation. Reasons a feature is
considered textbf{{Critical}} include but are not limited to:
\begin{{itemize}}
\item many user stories rely on the feature
\item funding or institutional obligations depend on the feature
\item a significant minority of users rely on the feature
\item repository experts aver that it is necessary
\item stakeholder buy-in depends on the feature
\end{{itemize}}
\item \textbf{{Major}} - While this feature is not necessary for the repository
to function, it is considered important to its operation and use.
Reasons a feature is considered \textbf{{Major}} include but are not limited to:
\begin{{itemize}}
\item a fair number of user stories rely on this feature
\item a small but involved constituency of users prioritizes this feature
\item potential stakeholder buy-in or funding opportunities may arise if this feature is implemented
\end{{itemize}}
\item \textbf{{Low}} - This feature would be good to have, but is
nonessential. Reasons a feature is considered \textbf{{Low}} include but are
not limited to:
\begin{{itemize}}
\item only a small segment of users rely on this feature
\item considered to be a niche or tangential repository function
\end{{itemize}} 
\end{{itemize}} 

This prioritization allowed us the determine an inferred priority for 
each user story: the lowest of the priorities of the features and 
policies that it relies on. This allowed refinement of the features and 
policies list, and their associated priorities.
